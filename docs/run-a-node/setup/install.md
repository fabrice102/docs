title: Install a Node
# Overview
This guide explains how to install the Algorand Node software on Linux Distributions and Mac OS. When installing on Linux, three methods are covered: *RPM installs*, *Debian installs* and *Other Linux Distributions*. The *Other Linux Distributions* method has been verified on Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Raspian (Raspberry Pi 3) and allows manually setting data directories and requires manual updates. The *RPM* and *Debian* installs use fixed directories and automatically update.

A node installation consists of two folders: the binaries (bin) and the data (data) folders. The bin folder can be created anywhere, but Algorand recommends `~/node`, if not using *RPM* or *Debian* installs. This location is referenced later in the documentation. Remember to replace this location in the documentation below with the correct location. It is assumed that this folder is dedicated to Algorand binaries and is archived before each update. Note that nothing is currently deleted, the binaries for Algorand are just overwritten.

When installing for the first time a `data` directory will need to be specified unless using the *RPM* or *Debian* install. Algorand recommends using a location under the `node` folder, e.g. `~/node/data`. See [Node Artifacts](../../reference/node/artifacts.md) reference for a detailed list of all files that are installed. An environment variable can be set that points to the data directory and goal will use this location if a specific `data` folder is not specified.

```
export ALGORAND_DATA=~/node/data 
```

When installing with *Debian* or *RPM* packages the binaries will be installed in the `/usr/bin` and the data directory will be set to `/var/lib/algorand`. It is advisable with these installs to add the following export to shell config files.

```
export ALGORAND_DATA=/var/lib/algorand
```

!!! info
    When installing with the *Debian* or *RPM* packages, `kmd` related files such as the kmd token file will be written to the `${HOME}/.algorand/kmd-version` directory. These files are primarily used with the SDKs and REST endpoints. See [REST Endpoints](../../reference/sdks/index.md#rest-endpoints) for more details.
 

# Installation Overview
Installing a new node is generally a 3 to 4-step process and will depend on the operating system. Each install option is listed in this guide and is accessible from the table of contents or select from the list below:

1. Installing on a Mac
2. Installing with Debian
3. Installing on Other Linux Distros


# Installing on a Mac
Verified on OSX v10.13.4 / High Sierra.

+ Create a temporary folder to hold the install package and files.

```
mkdir ~/node
cd ~/node
```

Download the updater script.
  
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand-doc/master/downloads/installers/update.sh -O
```  

+ Ensure that your system knows it's an executable file.
  
```
chmod 544 update.sh
```  

+ Run the installer from within your node directory.

```
./update.sh -i -c stable -p ~/node -d ~/node/data -n
```
When the installer runs, it will pull down the latest update package from S3 and install it. The `-n` option above tells the installer to not auto-start the node. If the installation succeeds the node will need to be started manually described later in this [guide](#start-node). 

!!! info
    When installing the `rel/beta` release, specify the beta channel `-c beta`

# Installing the Devtools

Beginning with the 2.1.5 release, there is now a new package called `algorand-devtools` that contains the developer tools.  The package contains the following binaries, some of which are new (as of 2.1.5) and some of which have been removed from the `algorand` package to decrease its size:

- carpenter
- catchupsrv
- msgpacktool
- tealcut
- tealdbg

Installing the devtools is simple and no additional entries need to be added for either `apt` or `yum` to be aware of them.  Simply install the tools as usual via the respective package manager. Since the `algorand` package is a dependency of `algorand-devtools` and the two former cannot be older than the latter, one of two possible scenarios will occur upon downloading the devtools:

- If `algorand` has not been previously installed, it will automatically download it.
- If `algorand` is installed but older than the devtools, it will automatically upgrade it.

See the examples below to understand how to install the deb and rpm packages.

!!! Note 
    If installing using the updater script (see the section *Installing with Other Linux Distros*) that all the binaries are downloaded  together, i.e., there is not a separate devtools archive file or package.

# Installing with Debian
Nodes have been verified on Ubuntu 18.04. Other Debian-based distros should work as well (use apt-get install rather than apt install).

+ Open a terminal and run the following commands.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gnupg2 curl software-properties-common
curl -O https://releases.algorand.com/key.pub
sudo apt-key add key.pub
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://releases.algorand.com/deb/ stable main"
sudo apt-get update

# To get both algorand and the devtools:
sudo apt-get install -y algorand-devtools

# Or, to only install algorand:
sudo apt-get install -y algorand

algod -v
```

These commands will install and configure `algod` as a service and place the algorand binaries in the `/usr/bin` directory. These binaries will be in the path so the `algod` and `goal` commands can be executed from anywhere. Additionally, every node has a data directory, in this case, it will be set to `/var/lib/algorand`.

This install defaults to the Algorand MainNet network. See switching networks<LINK> for details on changing to another network.

> Most tools are included in the node binary package and do not require a separate install. There are a few additional tools (such as `pingpong`) in a separate tools package (i.e., `tools_stable_linux-amd64_2.1.6.tar.gz`).

!!! Note Since the data directory `/var/lib/algorand` is owned by the user `algorand` and the daemon `algod` is run as the user `algorand`, some operations such as the ones related to wallets and accounts keys (`goal account ...` and `goal wallet ...`) need to be run as the user `algorand`. For example, to list participation keys, use `sudo -u algorand -E goal account listpartkeys` (assuming the environment variable `$ALGORAND_DATA` is set to `/var/lib/algorand`) or `sudo -u algorand -E goal account listpartkey -d /var/lib/algorand` (otherwise). *Never run `goal` as `root` (e.g., `sudo goal account listpartkeys`).* Running `goal` as `root` can compromise the permissions of files in `/var/lib/algorand`.

# Installing with RPM
Installing on Fedora and Centos are described below. 

+ To install to CentOS, open a terminal and run the following commands.
  
```
curl -O https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/rpm_algorand.pub
sudo rpmkeys --import rpm_algorand.pub
sudo yum install yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/stable/algorand.repo

# To get both algorand and the devtools:
sudo yum install algorand-devtools

# Or, to only install algorand:
sudo yum install algorand
```

+ To install to Fedora open a terminal and run the following commands.
  
```
dnf install -y 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://releases.algorand.com/rpm/stable/algorand.repo
dnf install algorand
```

These commands will install and configure `algod` as a service and place the algorand binaries in the `/usr/bin` directory. These binaries will be in the path so the `algod` and `goal` commands can be executed from anywhere. Additionally, every node has a data directory, in this case, it will be set to `/var/lib/algorand`. 

This install defaults to the Algorand MainNet network. See switching networks<LINK> for details on changing to another network.

> Most tools are included in the node binary package and do not require a separate install. There are a few additional tools (such as `pingpong`) in a separate tools package (i.e., `tools_stable_linux-amd64_2.1.6.tar.gz`).

# Installing with Other Linux Distros
Nodes have been verified on Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Raspian (Raspberry Pi 1-4). Other modern distros should work as well.

+ Create a temporary folder to hold the install package and files.

```
mkdir ~/node
cd ~/node
```

Download the updater script.
  
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand-doc/master/downloads/installers/update.sh
```  

+ Ensure that your system knows it's an executable file.
  
```
chmod 544 update.sh
```  

+ Run the installer from within your node directory.

```
./update.sh -i -c stable -p ~/node -d ~/node/data -n
```

When the installer runs, it will pull down the latest update package from S3 and install it. The `-n` option above tells the installer to not auto-start the node. If the installation succeeds the node will need to be started manually described later in this [guide](#start-node). 


# Configure Telemetry
Algod is instrumented to provide telemetry which is used for insight into the software's performance and usage. Telemetry is disabled by default and so no data will be shared with Algorand Inc. Enabling telemetry provides data to Algorand to improve the software and help to identify issues. Telemetry can be enabled by following the commands below replacing &lt;name&gt; with your desired hostname (e.g. 'SarahsLaptop').

```
cd ~/node
./diagcfg telemetry name -n <name>
```
Telemetry can also be provided without providing a hostname:

```
./diagcfg telemetry enable
```

!!! info
    Telemetry can be disabled at any time by using the `./diagcfg telemetry disable` command.

Running the `diagcfg` commands will create and update the logging configuration settings stored in ~/.algorand/logging.config.

# Start Node 

+ The *Debian* and *RPM* installs automatically start the node. Starting and stopping a node installed with one of these packages should be done using `systemctl` commands:

```
sudo systemctl start algorand
```

```
sudo systemctl stop algorand
```


With these installs, the status of the node can be checked by running:

```
goal node status -d /var/lib/algorand
```

+ The *Mac* or *Other Linux Distros* installs require that the node be be started manually. This can be done from the `~node` directory with the following command:

```
./goal node start -d data
```

This will start the node and it can be verified by running:

```
pgrep algod
```

The node can be manually stopped by running:

```
./goal node stop -d data
```


# Sync Node with Network
When a node first starts, it will need to sync with the network. This process can take a while as the node is loading up the current ledger and catching up to the rest of the network. See the section below a [Fast Catchup](#sync-node-network-using-fast-catchup) option. The status can be checked by running the following goal command:

```
./goal node status -d data
```

The goal node status command will return information about the node and what block number it is currently processing. When the node is caught up with the rest of the network, the "Sync Time" will be 0.0 as in the example response below (if on MainNet, some details will be different).

# Sync Node Network using Fast Catchup 

Fast Catchup is a new feature and will rapidly update a node using catchpoint  snapshots. A new command on goal node is now available for catchup. The entire process should sync a node in minutes rather than hours or days. As an example, the results for a BetaNet fast catchup, at the time of writing this, was a couple minutes to get to the sync point and a few more minutes to sync the remaining blocks since the snapshot. The total blocks synced was around 4.2 million blocks and it finished syncing in under 6 minutes. Actual sync times may vary depending on the number of accounts, number of blocks and the network.  Here are the links to get the most recent catchup point snapshot per network. The results  include a round to catchup to and the provided catchpoint. Paste into the `goal node catchup` command.

BetaNet
https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/betanet/latest.catchpoint

TestNet
https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/testnet/latest.catchpoint

MainNet
https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/mainnet/latest.catchpoint

The results will look similar to this:
`4420000#Q7T2RRTDIRTYESIXKAAFJYFQWG4A3WRA3JIUZVCJ3F4AQ2G2HZRA`

Steps:

1) Start the node, if not started already, and run a status.

`./goal node start -d ~/node/datafastcatchup`

`./goal node status -d ~/node/datafastcatchup`

Results should look something like this...

```

Last Catchpoint: 
Genesis ID: betanet-v1.0
Genesis hash: mFgazF+2uRS1tMiL9dsj01hJGySEmPN28B/TjjvpVW0=
```
2) Use the sync point captured above and paste into the catchup option

`./goal node catchup 4420000#Q7T2RRTDIRTYESIXKAAFJYFQWG4A3WRA3JIUZVCJ3F4AQ2G2HZRA -d ~/node/datafastcatchup`

3) Run another status and results should look something like this showing a Catchpoint status:
`./goal node status -d ~/node/datafastcatchup`

Results should show 5 Catchpoint status lines for Catchpoint, total accounts, accounts processed, total blocks , downloaded blocks.

```
Last committed block: 4453
Sync Time: 15.8s
Catchpoint: 4420000#Q7T2RRTDIRTYESIXKAAFJYFQWG4A3WRA3JIUZVCJ3F4AQ2G2HZRA
Catchpoint total accounts: 1146
Catchpoint accounts processed: 1146
Catchpoint total blocks: 1000
Catchpoint downloaded blocks: 81
Genesis ID: betanet-v1.0
Genesis hash: mFgazF+2uRS1tMiL9dsj01hJGySEmPN28B/TjjvpVW0=
```
4) A new option can facilitate a status watch, -w which takes a parameter of time, in milliseconds, between two successive status updates. This will eliminate the need to repeatedly issue a status manually. Press ^c to exit the watch. 

`./goal node status -d ~/node/datafastcatchup -w 1000`

5) Notice that the 5 Catchpoint status lines will disappear when completed, and then only a few more minutes are needed so sync from that point to the current block. **Once there is a Sync Time of 0, the node is synced and if fully usable. **

# Updating Node
The *RPM* or *Debian* packages are updated automatically. For other installs, check for and install the latest updates by running `./update.sh -d ~/node/data` at any time from within your node directory. It will query S3 for available builds and see if there are newer builds than the currently installed version. To force an update, run `./update.sh -i -c stable -d ~/node/data`. 

If there is a newer version, it will be downloaded and unpacked. The node will shutdown, the binaries and data files will be archived, and the new binaries will be installed. If any part of the process fails, the node will restore the previous version (bin and data) and restart the node. If it succeeds, the new version is started. The automatic start can be disabled by adding the `-n` option.

Setting up a schedule to automatically check for and install updates can be done with CRON.

```
crontab -e 
```

Add a line that looks like this (run update.sh every hour, on the half-hour, of every day), where ‘user’ is the name of the account used to install / run the node:

```
30 * * * * /home/user/node/update.sh -d /home/user/node/data >/home/user/node/update.log 2>&1
```


# DNS Configuration for betanet
For the `betanet` network, when installing a new node or relay, make the following modification to the `config.json` file located in the node's data directory. 
First, if there is not a config.json, make a copy of the config.json.example file.  
```
cp config.json.example config.json
```
Then edit the config.json file and replace the line
``` 
"DNSBootstrapID": "<network>.algorand.network",
```
with 
``` 
"DNSBootstrapID": "<network>.algodev.network",
```
This modification to the `DNSBootstrapID` is only required for the `betanet` network.
